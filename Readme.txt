This folder contains the source code needed to reproduce the results presented in the article "Retrieving the structure of probabilistic sequences of auditory stimuli from EEG data". The content is organized as follows:

(1) The folder preprocessing_raw_data contains the instructions to download the raw data and the source code used to preprocess that data. 

(2) The folder statistical_analysis contains the instructions to download the already preprocessed data (in case the users wanted to pull step 1 and begin working with the preprocessed data) and the source code used for the statistical analysis.

Each of the above mentioned folders contains its own Readme file explaining its content.
